# VEX-Problems
Hi, welcome. My name is Martin and these are a collection of VEX problems that I have encountered during my studies of learning Houdini. You will start from the "Start Here.hipnc" file that I have provided. The explanation about the problem and solution is available in the "Explanation.txt" file. I have also provided the solution as well. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions to improve the code or any other general workflows.
